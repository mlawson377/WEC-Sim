WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) is an open source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom as described in the WEC-Sim Theory Manual.

The WEC-Sim project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office and the code development effort is a collaboration between the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](www.nrel.gov/water) (NREL) and [Sandia National Laboratories](http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=834) (SNL).
